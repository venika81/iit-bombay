    <h1>About Amravati</h1>
    <b>Amravati is the second largest city in the Vidarbha region and ninth largest city in Maharashtra, India. It is administrative headquarters of Amravati district and Amravati division which includes Akola, Buldhana, Washim, and Yavatmal districts. It is one of the Maharashtra's nominated city under Smart Cities Mission.The ancient name of Amravati is ‚ÄúUdumbravati‚Äù, prakrut form of this is ‚ÄúUmbravati‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmravati‚Äù is known for many centuries with this name. The mispronunciation form of this is Amravati and now the Amravati is known with the same. It is said that Amravati is named for its ancient Ambadevi temple. The ancient proof of existence of Amravati can get from stone carved inscription on the base of marble statue of God Adinath (Jain God) Rhishabhnath. This shows that, these statues were set up here in 1097. Govind Maha Prabhu visited Amravati in 13 th century, at the same time Warhad was under the rule of Deogiri‚Äôs Hindu King (Yadav). In 14th century, there was famine (drought) in Amravati & people abandoned Amravati and left for Gujrat and Malva. The local people were returned back after several years at Amravati, the result of this was scanty population. In 16 th century, Mager Aurangpura (today‚Äôs, ‚ÄòSabanpura‚Äô) was presented for Jumma Majseed by Badashah Aurangzeb. This reveals that Muslims and Hindus lived together here. In 1722, Chhatrapati Shahoo Maharaj presented Amravati and Badnera to Shri Ranoji Bhosle, by the time Amravati was known as Bhosle ki Amravati. The city was reconstructed and prospered by Ranoji Bhosle after the treaty of Devgaon and Anjangaon Surji and victory over Gavilgad (Fort of Chikhaldara). The British general author Wellesly camped in Amravati, particular place is still recognized as camp, by Amravati people. The Amravati city came in to existence at the end of 18th century. Union state of Nizam and Bosale ruled the Amravati. They appointed the revenue officer, but defense system was worsted. Gavilgad fort was conquered by Britishers on 15th Dec‚Äô 1803. According to the Deogaon treaty, the Warhad was presented as the token of the friendship to Nizam. The Warhad had Nizams monopoly, thereafter. Near about 1805, Pendharies attacked Amravati city.</b>

             Amravati, a city in the state of Maharashtra, India, has a rich and vibrant history that dates back to the 11th century. The city was originally part of the Deogiri Kingdom in the 13th century. However, due to the dense forests, mountain ranges, and rugged terrains of the region, Amravati was sparsely populated. Despite this, it was a famous pilgrimage center, and people from near and far came to pay homage to Goddess Ambadevi.In 1722, Amravati, then known as Bhosle ki Amravati, was given to Shri Ranoji Bhosle by Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj. The city was reconstructed and prospered under Ranoji Bhosle‚Äôs rule after the treaty of Devgaon and Anjangaon Surji12. This period also saw the victory over Gavilgad, also known as the Fort of Chikhaldara. This fort, located in the Satpura range near Chikhaldara, was originally built by Bahami Sultan Ahmad Shah in 1425-264. It changed hands through various dynasties until it fell to the British Empire in 1803.The 18th century marked the emergence of Amravati city as we know it today. The city was governed by the union state of Nizam and Bosale, who appointed a revenue officer but had a weakened defense system. The British conquered the Gavilgad fort on December 15, 1803. According to the Deogaon treaty, the Warhad was presented as a token of friendship to the Nizam.Today, Amravati is the second-largest city in the Vidarbha region and the ninth-largest city in Maharashtra. It serves as the administrative headquarters of the Amravati district and the Amravati division, which includes Akola, Buldhana, Washim, and Yavatmal districts1. The city continues to be a place of historical interest and importance, with landmarks like the Gavilgad Fort standing as a testament to its rich past.

             Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple, also known as the Gavipura Cave Temple, located in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. This temple is an example of Indian rock-cut architecture and is famous for its mysterious stone discs in the forecourt and the exact planning allowing the sun to shine on the shrine during certain times of the year.The temple is believed to have been built by Gautama Maharshi and Bharadwaja Muni in the Vedic period. It was later renovated in the 16th century AD by Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bengaluru1. One of the oldest temples in Bengaluru, the Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple was built by Kempe Gowda in recognition after being released from a prison term of five years by Rama Raya.The temple is built in a natural cave in Gavipuram and is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The courtyard of the temple contains several monolithic sculptures. The main attractions of the Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple are two granite pillars that support the giant disk of the sun and moon, and two pillars having several carvings of Nandi in a sitting posture at the top. The temple complex has numerous shrines for various deities in addition to the main deity Gavi Gangadhareshwara1. On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, the temple witnesses a unique phenomenon in the evening where sunlight passes through an arc between the horns of Nandi and falls directly on the linga inside the cave, illuminating the interior idol for an hour.
