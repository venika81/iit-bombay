          The Shree Kalaram Temple is a significant Hindu temple located in the Panchavati area of Nashik, Maharashtra, India. The temple is dedicated to the deity Rama, and its name derives from the black statue of Rama housed within it. The literal translation of “Kalaram” is "black Rama".

          The temple also houses the statues of the goddess Sita and the god Lakshmana1. Thousands of devotees visit the temple every day.

          The original temple, dedicated to an unknown deity, was very old, estimated to be from the Rashtrakuta Period (7th to 11th centuries). The current temple was funded by Sardar Rangarao Odhekar and was built around 178812. According to a story, Odhekar had a dream that the statue of Rama in black color was in the Godavari River. He retrieved the statue from the river and built the temple.

          The temple played a pivotal role in the Dalit movement in India. B. R. Ambedkar led a protest outside the temple on 2 March 1930, to allow Dalits into the temple.

          The temple is constructed completely out of black stones and has four entrance doors, one each facing East, West, South, and North. The summit of the Kalaram Mandir is made up of 32 tons of gold.

          At a distance of 2 km from Nashik Central Bus Station, Sundarnarayan temple is situated at the corner of Ahillyabai Holkar Bridge near Ram Kund in Panchavati area of Nashik.

          The Sundarnarayan Temple is built by Gangadhar Yashwant Chandrachud in 1756. The presiding deity of the temple is Lord Vishnu as Sundarnarayan. According to legend, once the area was a place haunted by an evil demon named Jalandar who was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva. Even though the demon was wild and practiced evil deeds, he had a pious and virtuous wife Vrinda Devi. Lord Shiva was highly impressed by his devotion and he blessed the demon with a boon of immortality. This boon made Jalandar to create destruction in the area.

          The Gods realized the importance to kill the demon to save the mankind. The Gods approached Lord Vishnu to help them in this noble cause. Lord Vishnu understood that the chastity and piousness of Jalandar's wife is acting as a shield to his life. Lord Vishnu adopted the look of Jalandar and started living with his wife. He challenged the chastity of the women and killed Jalandar. When Jalandar's wife Devi Vrinda came to know this, she cursed Lord Vishnu to turn black and ugly. The curse of the lady made him dark and he had to take a holy dip in River Godavari to regain his original form. After regaining his original form, Lord Vishnu was called Sundarnarayan.

          The temple presents imposing architecture especially the vaulted niche, which strikes a chord with the Mughal sculpture. The east-facing temple has three porches with balcony, lobed arches and globular domes. The main deity Lord Vishnu flanked by Lakshmi and Saraswati is placed in the sanctum. There are small carvings of Hanuman, Narayana and Indira on the walls. The most remarkable thing about this temple is the angle at which it is built. The sun rays of rising sun first fall directly on the idols on March 21st every year. Thousands of devotees visit this temple on this day to witness this holy event.
